## Setup

Make sure to get a virtual environment up and running.

1. Run `python -m venv venv`
2. Run `source venv/bin/activate`. If on Windows, run `venv/Scripts/activate` instead.
3. You should now be in your virtual environment. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all dependencies.

You're good to go!

## Running the server

Simply run `flask run` in this directory (`./backend`). It should start on `localhost:5000`.
