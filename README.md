### Running Web UI locally

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Run the environment: `npm run dev`

## Making *changes*
1. Making SASS (CSS) changes? Make sure you have the SASS compiler watching your every move by opening another terminal window and running `npm run sass`.

That's it. The environment hot-reloads, so your React changes will automatically update the relevant components on the page.

After this, it should start a local server where you can view, work on, and test the web UI.
